  <h2 class="hidden offset">Magnetic Properties</h2>
  <p class="hidden offset">There are different types of metals with different magnetic properties. Only a few metals are magnetic and some are better suited for making a typical magnet.</p>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Magnetic Materials</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Magnetic materials can be attracted by magnets but not repelled. Magnetic hardness is a measure of how easily a magnetic material can be magnetised. Iron is magnetically soft while steel is hard. This means it is harder to change the magnetic field of steel objects.</p>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>Iron (Ferrous)</li>
    <li>Cobalt</li>
    <li>Nickel</li>
  </ul>

    <div class="note">
      Steel is an alloy of iron. Alloys can inherit some properties like magnetism. Alloys containing iron are called ferrous.

  <h3 class="hidden offset">Permanent Magnets</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Permanent magnets last a long time like typical bar magnets, horseshoe magnets, and refrigerator magnets. They are harder to magnetise and demagnetise. It is important to remember that the magnetic field flows from <strong>north to south</strong>!</p>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>Hard Magnetic Material (Steel)</li>
    <li>North Pole & South Pole</li>
    <li>Attract & Repel</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Electromagnets</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Electromagnets are usually temporary magnets made by passing electricity through a coil.</p>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>Soft Magnetic Core (Iron)</li>
    <li>North Pole & South Pole</li>
    <li>Attract & Repel</li>
  </ul>

    <div class="note">
      Only <strong>direct current</strong> can be used to make electromagnets because the field lines constantly change in alternating current.

  <h2 class="hidden offset">Grip Rule</h2>
  <p class="hidden offset">The right-hand grip rule is used to determine the rotation of a magnetic field produced by a current flowing through a wire. The thumb points in the direction of the current while the fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field.</p>

  <h2 class="hidden offset">Fleming's Hand Rules</h2>
  <div class="callout">

    </div>
    <div class="note">
      Some people prefer to use the right-hand slap rule over Fleming's left-hand rule because it is very similar to the grip rule.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="hidden offset">Fleming's hand rules are used to determine the relative directions of a current, force, and magnetic field. Fleming's left-hand rule applies to situations where a force is being produced by a current. Fleming's right-hand rule applies to situations where a current is being produced by a force. In both cases, the thumb is the force, the index finger is the magnetic field, and the middle finger is the direction of the current.</p>

    <div class="note">
      The motor effect is more commonly asked than the generator effect. However, it is crucial to know the applications of both hand rules.
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">DC Motor</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">The left-hand rule says the direction of the force is upwards if the magnetic field is pointing forward and the current is flowing to the right. This is Fleming's left-hand rule.</p>
  <div class="diagram hidden">
    <img src="#{ path }#images/dc motor.png" alt="dc motor">
  </div>
  <p class="hidden offset">The DC motor in the diagram would alternate between half clockwise and anti-clockwise rotations due to the lack of a commutator. A split ring commutator ensures that the motor will always spin in the same direction.</p>

  </div>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">AC Generator</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">The current flows left instead of right in Fleming's right-hand rule. This is because kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy.</p>
